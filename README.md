# About

- **Today Only** is a TODO app which tracks and manages your day-to-day tasks.
- The application holds only one day's tasks and updates automatically every day to start with the tasks which you will cover on that day.
- The app tracks three types of tasks:
  - **Routine**, tasks which you do every day, these tasks are marked complete automatically.
  - **Unusual**, tasks you perform sometimes, these tasks are marked expired if not marked complete manually.
  - **Exceptional**, tasks you are not sure about. They are left untouched, only you can change the state of such tasks.
- Local Storage API is used to store all the user tasks and an automatic cleanup is triggered at the end of the day.
- A small tracker is provided which holds the number of tasks, tasks completed, and expired tasks. Moreover, it also shows how much of the day has passed and how much is left.
